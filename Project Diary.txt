Project Diary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day one 20/04:
Brainstormed ideas for projects themed around D&D 
Ideas included
-Player Inventory management system
-Encounter Generators
-Character Generators
-An In-game shop for players to buy from
-A "Build your party" Minigame
-A player and store inventory management and purchase system 

I decided to settle on the Player Inventory Management system as this could be useful to players and feels fairly straightforward to work on.
