Project Diary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day one 20/04:
Brainstormed ideas for projects themed around D&D 
Ideas included
-Player Inventory management system
-Encounter Generators
-Character Generators
-An In-game shop for players to buy from
-A "Build your party" Minigame
-A player and store inventory management and purchase system 

I decided to settle on the Player Inventory Management system as this could be useful to players and feels fairly straightforward to work on.

-Had a look for D&D APIs, Saw that D&D Beyond is working on its own but it is not functional as of yet.

Day Four 23/04:

Due to familly commitments I could not spend as much time on the project as I would've liked to today but in the time I 
managed to squeeze in, here's what was done.

-Built Spring Project on Eclipse successfully
Was having issues getting it to run, found this was due to not configuring the JDBC correctly, attempted multiple times with
different configurations in application.properties to set up the jdbc connection, however decided to remove the dependency
for now and return to it at a later date. The dependency is below so that I can copy/paste this back later. 

-Rewatched Morgans Monday lessons to fill in gaps on knowledge.
