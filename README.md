This project was used to create a website interface with an API for characters and the party's inventory. 

The project was comprised of a single week long sprint, as such there are improvements I would make given more time.
-General polishing of interface.
-Displaying character name instead of ID in inventory page.
-Permanent images instead of publicly hosted images.
